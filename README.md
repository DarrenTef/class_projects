# 🚀 CSE101 & CSE13: My Journey Through Data Structures, Algorithms, and Systems Programming 🖥️

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my learning and projects from **CSE101** (Data Structures and Algorithms) and **CSE13** (Computer Systems and C Programming). Both courses have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of programming, algorithms, and systems-level concepts. Let me walk you through what I've learned! 🌟

## 📚 **CSE101: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms**
In **CSE101**, I dived deep into **C** and **C++**, focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms. Here's a glimpse of what I worked on:

### 🛠️ **Programming Assignments**
1. **Doubly Linked Lists** 📜  
   - Implemented and manipulated doubly linked lists in C++.
2. **Graph ADT and BFS** 🌐  
   - Built a Graph Abstract Data Type (ADT) and implemented Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. **Strongly Connected Components & DFS** 🔗  
   - Explored Depth-First Search (DFS) to find strongly connected components in graphs.
4. **Matrix ADT & Sparse Matrix Operations** 🧮  
   - Created a sparse matrix and performed matrix operations efficiently.
5. **List ADT in C++** 📋  
   - Designed and implemented a List ADT in C++.
6. **Big Integer ADT in C++** 🔢  
   - Built a Big Integer ADT to handle large numbers.
7. **Dictionary ADT (BST)** 🌳  
   - Implemented a Dictionary ADT using Binary Search Trees (BST).
8. **Dictionary ADT (RBT)** 🌲  
   - Extended the Dictionary ADT using Red-Black Trees (RBT) for balanced operations.
